# chess-app

Purpose: The purpose of this project is to provide an open source, easily accessible multiplayer chess game. This is done via multiple self scaling microservices.

How I work: The entrypoint to the application is the client socket. Once connected, this allows user to make calls to all internal microservices, providing game functionality.

How to deploy: Simple, build/deploy all the docker images, exposing the applicable port and setting the desired environment variables.

Server communications:
    hive -> judicial
    chess -> client_socket, archive //bidirectional communication with client
    queue -> chess
